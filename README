	by R.E.M.
==============================
some utility classes written by cpp.




USAGE
==============================
check the related header file to get the usage of the classes.
check "Tester.cpp" for code example for using each class.


CLASS LIST ( IMPLEMENTED )
==============================
[[ algorithm ]]
	[ BidirectionIndex ] :
	this can be used as an O(1) implementation of set<int>  
	when the integers are aggregate in certain range. 
	for example, vertex set in topological graph.

	[ Graph ] :
	Geometrical Graph/Topological Graph,
	DirectedGraph/UndirectedGraph,
	matrix representation/ajacent table representation,
	some basic algorithm on graph.

	[ Counter ] :
	auto incremental function object.

	[ SetOperation ] :
	operation on set such as contain.


[[ log ]]
	[ Timer ] :
	provide interface to check if timeout in single thread procedure.

	[ TimeStamp ] :
	record a series of timestamps.

	[ Log ] :
	make it easy to show log when debuging and 
	avoid too much log in release version.

	[ Trace ] :
	record program running state and dump call stack after crash.


[[ random ]]
	[ Random ] :
	base class of all random number generators.
	provide initialization interface by seed or sequence.

	[ RandSelect ] :
	make it possible to pick one element out of a sequence of elements 
	by same probability without recording all of them.
	it can also select a certain number of elements out of a vector randomly.

	[ RangeRand ] :
	select a integer in a range by same probability.


[[ type ]]
	[ Convert ] :
	convert between std::string and other type.

	[ Double ] :
	encaptured fundamental type double.
	make it easier to compare two floating point number by tolerate some error.

	[ VectorMD ] :
	simplify multi-dimensional vector representation.


[[ io ]]
	[ File ] :
	file operations.


[[ system ]]
	[ Directory ] :
	portable directory operations.

	[ System ] :
	portable shell commands.

	[ Termination ] :
	program termination control.
	

CLASS LIST ( IN THE PLAN )
==============================

 integer without precision loss.

[ Rational ] :
rational number without precision loss.

[ Trie ] :
dictionary tree.

[ SuffixTree ] :


[ AVLTree ] :


[ RedBlackTree ] :


[ RationalNubmer ] :
record rational numbers without accuracy loss.
